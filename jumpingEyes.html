                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
         "Jumping Eyes" is an interactive game inspired by Google's dinosaur game. It brings players a novel gaming experience by adding facial recognition technology. In the game, players can use the position of their eyes to control the character and jump to avoid obstacles. The game retains the core parkour elements of the original Dinosaur game while incorporating modern technology and innovative interactive methods. Uniquely, the game includes interesting sound effects recorded by the author himself, which combined with the interactive features and visual style of the game provide players with a pleasant and interesting game atmosphere. While playing the game, players can not only experience the fun of traditional games, but also feel the charm of machine learning.
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
           "Jumping Eyes" shows how technology and creativity can transform classic games to provide players with a whole new experience. Combining the classic parkour gameplay of Google Dinosaur Mini Game with modern facial recognition technology, the game creates a unique gaming environment for players, which is difficult to achieve in traditional games. The author's self-recorded sound effects add a personal touch to the game. These sound effects not only enrich the sensory experience of the game, but also enhance the player's immersion. Through these innovations, the game not only shows players the potential of technology in game design, but also proves that even simple games can become unique and engaging through creativity.
